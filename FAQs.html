          Poor people are more likely to live and work in areas exposed to potential
          hazards, while they are less likely to have the resources to cope when a
          disaster strikes. If the community is considered as poor they also have
          poor knowledge and tools that might help them when a natural disaster strikes.
          Places that are far from cities that doesn't have enough knowlede and informations
          about natural disasters are carrying vulnerability whenever a phenomena happens.

      <p>
          Changes in animal behavior can not be used to predict earthquakes.
          Even though there have been documented cases of unusual animal behavior
          prior to earthquakes, a reproducible connection between a specific
          behavior and the occurrence of an earthquake has not been made.
          Animals change their behavior for many reasons and given that an
          earthquake can shake millions of people, it is likely that a few
          of their pets will, by chance, be acting strangely before an earthquake.

          Why do earthquakes happen at night most of the time?

      <p>
          Earthquakes can and do happen at any time, day or night, late or early.
          Earthquakes originate miles below the surface of the earth. There is
          no way that time of day could have any effect on seismic activity.
           There are earthquake site like Cal-tech, who scan the list of earthquakes,
           you'll see that earthquakes occur at all hours of the day and night.
           Earthquakes occur when the amount of stress on faults is great enough
           to cause slip and is not based on a particular time of day. Earthquakes
           are not nocturnal. The earthquake that caused the devastating tsunami
           in Japan occurred at 2:46 p.m. The earthquake that caused the horrific
           tsunami and ghastly loss of life in the Indian ocean occurred at around 8 a.m.
           Yes, there is some tiny correlation between quakes and the tides
           because the water rolls in and out thus increasing stresses on a
           fault which is just about to rupture anyway, but the sunlight or
           lack of sunlight introduced no such stresses.

          Natural disasters are natural events and we can't do anything to stop
          it but , one thing we could do is to control it. We individuals can
          contribute in controlling the natural disasters by simply disciplining
          ourselves in throwing our garbage in the proper place in order to lessen
          the effects and risks of natural disasters. And since we live in a modern
          society, we can use our  technologies to share our knowledge or ideas on
          how to control natural disasters and we can basically spread it throughout
          the internet, so that every single one of us can help in controlling it.
           And also we can improve different structures with the help of our
           government so that it could reduce the amount of damage the natural
           disasters can cause. Natural disasters are catastrophic events that
           we can't avoid but, being ready by its causes can help save lives of
           billions of people.

        <h2> Why we need to know the

        Disasters are events that have a huge impact on humans and the environment.
        Disasters are inevitable, we cannot do anything to prevent these but disaster
        preparedness is only in our hand. Disasters management requires government
        intervention and a proper planning as well as funding. It is not necessary
        that these disasters are always unpredictable. Floods take place in valleys
        and floodplains, droughts in areas with unstable and low rainfall, and oil
        spills happen in shipping lanes. This predictability provides opportunities
        to plan for, prevent and to lessen the impact of disasters. Disasters are
        inevitable although we do not always know when and where they will happen.
        But their worst effects can be partially or completely prevented by preparation,
        early warning, and swift, decisive responses.
        <br>
        <br>
        Disaster management aims to reduce the occurrence of disasters and to
        reduce the impact of those that cannot be prevented. Disaster management forces come into action as soon as a disaster strikes and help out in the relief, rescue and rehabilitation process. These are trained individuals and are given extensive training to perform in the event of a disaster or a natural calamity and they work as a team to reduce the loss of life and helping the locals getting back to normal life.
