          A volcanic eruption is one of the most dangerous and magnificent natural
          disasters.  When a volcano erupts, the volcano sends out ash clouds,
          lava and even volcanic bombs.  There is a high risk of danger from slow
          moving lava; though, the lava might move slowly, it is very dangerous
          and can cause a lot of damage to property and human life.
          <br>
          <br>
          Volcanic eruptions happen deep down inside the earth.  When the earth’s
          tectonic plate’s shift, it causes more than just earthquakes, it can
          create new volcanoes or vents.  Underneath the surface of the earth,
          debris, gases from the planet and molten rock are stored creating new
          formations of vents and volcanoes.
          <br>
          <br>
          There are more than 1500 active volcanoes on the Earth. We currently
          know of 80 or more which are under the oceans. Active volcanoes in the
          U.S. are found mainly in Hawaii, Alaska, California, Oregon and Washington.
          Also near the Pacific Ring of Fire.

          The Ring of Fire, also referred to as the Circum-Pacific Belt, is a
          path along the Pacific Ocean characterized by active volcanoes and
          frequent earthquakes. Its length is approximately 40,000 kilometers
          (24,900 miles). It traces boundaries between several tectonic plates,
          including the Pacific, Juan de Fuca, Cocos, Indian-Australian, Nazca,
          North American, and Philippine Plates.
          <br>
          <br>
          Seventy-five percent of Earth’s volcanoes more than 450 volcanoes are
          located along the Ring of Fire. Ninety percent of Earth’s earthquakes
          occur along its path, including the planet’s most violent and dramatic
          seismic events.
          <br>
          <br>
          The abundance of volcanoes and earthquakes along the Ring of Fire is
          caused by the amount of movement of tectonic plates in the area. Along
          much of the Ring of Fire, plates overlap at convergent boundaries called
          subduction zones. That is, the plate that is underneath is pushed down,
          or subducted, by the plate above. As rock is subducted, it melts and
          becomes magma. The abundance of magma so near to Earth’s surface gives
          rise to conditions ripe for volcanic activity. A significant exception
          is the border between the Pacific and North American Plates. This stretch
          of the Ring of Fire is a transform boundary, where plates move sideways
          past one another. This type of boundary generates a large number of
          earthquakes as tension in Earth’s crust builds up and is released.

            The biggest volcanic eruption in human history occurred in 1815 on
            the Indonesian island of Sumbawa, leaving 100,000 dead. There was
            between six months and three years of steaming and small eruptions
            after the initial one. Because of the 400 million ton cloud of gas
            the volcano created, the earth began to cool and 1816 became known
            as "The Year Without Summer" because of the low temperatures, which
            killed crops and led to mass starvation.

          Standing at 2.46 kilometers high, Mayon Volcano is surrounded by three
          cities in Albay province, about 11 hours away from Manila if you travel
          by car. It has a record of 51 eruptions, with the most violent being
          recorded in February of 1814. Mayon’s alert level to four on a scale of
          five, and the danger zone was expanded 8km from the crater. At least 56,217
          people were taking shelter in 46 evacuation camps.
