          The phenomenon we call tsunami is a series of large waves of extremely
          long wavelength and period usually generated by a violent, impulsive
          undersea disturbance or activity near the coast or in the ocean. When
          a sudden displacement of a large volume of water occurs, or if the sea
          floor is suddenly raised or dropped by an earthquake, big tsunami waves
          can be formed.  The waves travel out of the area of origin and can be
          extremely dangerous and damaging when they reach the shore.
          <br>
          <br>
          Tsunami waves often look like walls of water and can attack the shoreline
          and be dangerous for hours, with waves coming every 5 to 60 minutes. The
          first wave may not be the largest, and often it is the 2nd, 3rd, 4th or
          even later waves that are the biggest. After one wave inundates, or
          floods inland, it recedes seaward often as far as a person can see
          so the seafloor is exposed. The next wave then rushes ashore within
          minutes and carries with it many floating debris that were destroyed
          by previous waves. When waves enter harbors, very strong and dangerous
          water currents are generated that can easily break ship moorings, and
          bores that travel far inland can be formed when tsunamis enter rivers
          or other waterway channels.

      <p>What is Tidal Waves?</p>

          Tides are the daily rise and fall of sea level at any given place.
          The pull of the Moon’s gravity on Earth is the primarily cause of tides
          and the pull of the Sun’s gravity on Earth is the secondary cause. The
          Moon has a greater effect because, although it is much smaller than the Sun,
          it is much closer. The Moon’s pull is about twice that of the Sun’s.
          <br>
          <br>
          To understand the tides it is easiest to start with the effect of the
          Moon on Earth. As the Moon revolves around our planet, its gravity pulls
          Earth toward it. The lithosphere is unable to move much but the water
          above it is pulled by the gravity and a bulge is created. This bulge is
          the high tide beneath the Moon. The Moon’s gravity then pulls the Earth
          toward it, leaving the water on the opposite side of the planet behind.
          This creates a second high tide bulge on the opposite side of Earth from
          the Moon. These two water bulges on opposite sides of the Earth aligned
          with the Moon are the high tides. Click here to learn more.Since so much
          water is pulled into the two high tides, low tides form between the two
           tides. As the Earth rotates beneath the Moon, a single spot will experience
           two high tides and two low tides every day.The tidal range is the difference
           between the ocean level at high tide and the ocean at low tide. The tidal
           range in a location depends on a number of factors, including the slope of
           the seafloor. Water appears to move a greater distance on a gentle slope
           than on a steep slope.

            Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, tsunami that hit the coasts of several
            countries of South and Southeast Asia in December 2004. The tsunami
            and its aftermath were responsible for immense destruction and loss
            on the rim of the Indian Ocean. On December 26, 2004, at 7:59 AM local
            time, an undersea earthquake with a magnitude of 9.1 struck off the
            coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Over the next seven hours,
            a tsunami, a series of immense ocean waves triggered by the quake reached
            out across the Indian Ocean, devastating coastal areas as far away as
            East Africa. Some locations reported that the waves had reached a
            height of 30 feet (9 metres) or more when they hit the shoreline.
            The tsunami killed at least 225,000 people across a dozen countries,
            with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Maldives, and Thailand sustaining
            massive damage. Indonesian officials estimated that the death toll
            there alone ultimately exceeded 200,000, particularly in northern
            Sumatra’s Aceh province. Tens of thousands were reported dead or
            missing in Sri Lanka and India, a large number of them from the
            Indian Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory. The low-lying island
            country of Maldives reported more than a hundred casualties and
            immense economic damage.

          <p>
            A few minutes after the last stroke of midnight on August 17, 1976,
            a violent earthquake occurred in the island of Mindanao spawning a
            tsunami that devastated more than 700 kms of coastline bordering Moro
            Gulf in the North Celebes Sea. This offshore event generated by Cotabato
            trench, a less prominent trench system in the Philippines, was the largest
             tsunamigenic earthquake to have occurred in Mindanao in the last two decades.
             It was an earthquake that resulted in massive destruction of properties
             and great loss of lives. The tsunami generated contributed immensely to
             the devastation. The cities and provinces of Cotabato took the brunt of
             the earthquake while the tsunami generated cast its doom on the provinces
             bordering Moro Gulf especially on the shores of Pagadian City. According
             to surveys during the event, the tsunami was responsible for 85% of
             deaths, 65% of injuries and 95% of those missing. After the sea
             spent its fury and rolled back to its natural flow, thousands of
             people were left dead, others homeless or missing and millions of
             pesos lost with the damages of properties. Properties lost not
             only include establishments for residential and commercial use,
             but also bancas that, as a whole, represents the livelihood of
             hundreds of families.
