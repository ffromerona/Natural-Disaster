          An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting
          from the sudden release of energy in the Earth’s lithosphere that
          creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that
          are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss
          people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity or seismic
          activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes
          experienced over a period of time.
          <br>
          <br>
          At the Earth’s surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and
          sometimes displacement of the ground. When the epicenter of a large
          earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently
          to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides, and occasionally
          volcanic activity. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is
          used to describe any seismic event whether natural or caused by humans
          that generates seismic waves.An earthquake’s point of initial rupture
          is called its focus or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground
          level directly above the hypocenter.

          A seismic wave is a wave that travels through the Earth, most often as
          the result of a tectonic earthquake, sometimes from an explosion.When
          an earthquake happens deep underground a crack will start to open
          on a pre-existing line of weakness in the Earth's brittle crust. This
          crack will then grow larger and larger, relieving built-up stress as
          it goes.
          <br>
          <br>
          The speed at which the crack propagates or grows is 2–3 km/sec. Eventually
          the rupture will cease to grow and will slow down and stop. The size or
          magnitude of the earthquake depends upon how much the fault has ruptured
          (the slip) and also the area over which the rupture has occurred.
          These waves can also help to determine the depths of layers of molten
          and semi-molten rock and other things within the earth. When there is
          an earthquake about to occur, Primary Waves are the first one to arrive.
          <br>
          <br>
          This rupturing process creates elastic waves in the Earth that propagate
          away from the rupture front at a much faster speed than the rupture propagates,
          the exact speed depends upon the nature of the wave (a longitudinal or
          P-wave is faster than a transverse or S-wave), and on the elastic properties
          of the Earth. As you go deeper into the Earth, the density and pressure
          increases and so do the velocities of seismic waves.

          The world's largest earthquake with an instrumentally documented magnitude
          occurred on May 22, 1960 near Valdivia, in southern Chile. It was assigned
          a magnitude of 9.5 by the United States Geological Survey. It is referred
          to as the "Great Chilean Earthquake" and the "1960 Valdivia Earthquake."
          The earthquake occurred beneath the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Chile.
          Ground motion from this earthquake destroyed or damaged thousands of buildings.
          The Chilean government estimated that about 2,000,000 people were left homeless.
          There are many different casualty estimates for this earthquake.

            The tremors came unexpectedly, like a thief in the middle of the night.
            At exactly eleven minutes past midnight on August 17, 1976, a massive
            earthquake with the magnitude varying between 7.9 and 8.2 on the Richter
            scale jolted those in the areas surrounding Moro Gulf in Mindanao.The
            sudden movements of the earth proved to be destructive in Cotabato,
            where 1,500 people perished after several buildings were reduced into
            pathetic rubble. In Pagadian, a coastal city 80 miles northwest of Cotabato,
            the quake was enough to wake people from a deep sleep and make them
            realize that something unusual was about to unfold.
